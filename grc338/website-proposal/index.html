            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Though tea is consumed by a range of ages, as it is the second most drank drink (the first being water) the primary target audience would be around the range of 25-35 year olds, though it is quite flexible within the adult age range. Additional research shows that 87% of Millenials buy and consume  teas, which lines up with the age range provided.</p>
           
            <p>Their primary task for visiting the website would be to browse and purchase the types of teas offered at the company, which offer a range of flavors, health benefits and scents. Outside from general consumption, tea is an additional supply found in regular crafts, which could also draw home and wellness enthusiasts,looking to find scented and natural products to take home.</p>
